My name is Sebastian Källstedt and I am 27 years old. I originally come from Malmköping in Södermanland,
but haven't lived there for many years. I have a 3 year degree in digital media production from Umeå university 
and have after I received that lived in Germany for two years as well as backpacked in New Zealand and Indonesia.

In Germany I lived close to Berlin and worked in Berlin center as an IT-support for cloud businesses. Living in Berlin
was great and I can see myself moving back there after my studies here at LNU kalmar is done.

I love to travel and meet new people and that is why I decided to go backpacking for almost 8 month in New Zealand
and south east asia. This was the best thing I have ever done and something that I have to do again.

A part from traveling my interests are computers, gaming, doing sports, reading and watching sports.
I have a big sports interest and watch pretty much everything that is on TV or that I can watch live.
I play floorball, go running and badmintone, as well as go to the gym. I have played floorball on a semi-proffesionall 
level, but am not currently not doing that. 

I love to learn new things and I always find something interesting that I need to know more about, downloading an ebook
about the subjuct. 

In the future I hope to get a job in an other country, where Germany, Czech republic (where I also have lived before), New Zealand,
USA or Japan is high up on the list. I would firstly like to work in a startup to experience that before hopefully moving on 
to a more established company.
