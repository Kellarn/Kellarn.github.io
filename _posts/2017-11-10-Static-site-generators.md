### Q: What do you think of static site generators?

Static site generators are a great help when designing and creating webpages not only becuase it is fairly easy to set up and use but also because it creates a standard file system and layout to work with, as well as a site to start design out of. It gives you more flexability and more control over your project than for example other CMSs like Wordpress or Joomla. When using a SSG you have all the tools to create a webpage that looks professional, feels professional and gives other developers that might work with the site after you easy access and control over the full file system. Because it creats almost all neccessary files and folders to start designing right away, it also saves you time, as soon is you have it all up and running. 

SSGs are usefull for projects and sites that doesn't need to use any advanced tools that uses forms of real-time dynamic content but for pages like blogs, portfolios or presentations in different forms, and SSG site is a great choice.
