### Q: What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

I think pre-compiling CSS is a great help and teqhnice when building websites.
It helps organize your CSS in both that it feels easier creating different modules for different parts of the website,
but it also makes it much easier to keep the code short and clean. With that I mean that since you are 
creating variables to use it is much easier to just have to change your code in one place instead of 10
and it also makes it faster to find what to change if you know how your models are built.
Also that the pre-compiler makes you aware of types and tells you when you have missed for example a ; is a big plus compared to regular CSS.

Compared to regular CSS I say that pre-compiling is the next logical step, and it feels that way as well.
Also they way nest elements inside other elements feels much more logical!

The techniques I used for this project were creating variables for different colors that are used more than once, organizing in different modules, nesting elements, mathematical operators to adjust for example font-size and spacing.

The pros of pre-compiling is pretty much everything. It is time-saving, efficient and it uses the DRY method that has been talked about a lot in our courses. When you understand how to use pre-compiling CSS it gives you many tools to make your workflow better, faster and stronger.
The cons with it might be that you need to use special tools to make it work, but today these tools are so sofisticated that they are barrely a minor stop on the way to use pre-compiling to maximum.
